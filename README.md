# TFCV- Tensorflow Computer Vision

TFCV is my repo for experimenting with Computer Vision models in Tensorflow 2. The goal is to have everything simple and searchable.
<br><br>

* **TO-DO**: 
    * [ ] pick apart and implement [RetinaNet repo](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet) for understanding 
    * [ ] create notebooks for each piece w/ visualizations and understanding
    * [ ] run model w/ hyperparameters from RetinaFace modified for tf==2.2 and if good enough convert to tflite
    * [ ] take trained model and fine tune with ArcFace loss for face embeddding
    * [ ] convert that to tflite and get working on RaspberryPi
