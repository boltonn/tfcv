# TFCV- Tensorflow Computer Vision

TFCV is my repo for experimenting with Computer Vision models in Tensorflow 2. The goal is to have everything simple and searchable.


| Section | Description |
|-|-|
| [Image Classification]() | Image classification models |
| [Object Detection]() | Object Detection models |
| [Face Verification]() | Face embedding methods |


| [Notebooks](#quick-tour) | Step-by-step guide to implementation of the models |
| [Models ](#models) | Models trained usign this repo |
| [Literature Review](LitReview.md) | Literature review w/ links and notes |

*All other sections are code written in old version of Tensorflow that I will replace*
